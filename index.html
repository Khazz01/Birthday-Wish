    <p>Wishing you all the happiness in the world on your special day!</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <p> Happy birthday to the love of my life. I'm deeply sorry that I'm not in a position to get you a gift right now. I know how much you were looking forward to celebrating this special day, and I'm heartbroken that I couldn't make it happen.

Please know that my love for you hasn't changed, and I'm committed to making it up to you as soon as I'm able to. You're the reason I wake up with a smile on my face, and I don't want you to ever feel like you're not valued or loved.

I know things might seem tough right now, but I want you to hold on to the love we share. I promise to be here for you, to support you, and to make you happy. You're my everything, and I don't want you to give up on us.

Here's to many more adventures, laughter, and memories to come. I love you more than words can express. Happy birthday, my love.</p>
